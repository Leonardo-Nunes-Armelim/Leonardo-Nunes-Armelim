### Hi there 👋

I’m Leonardo, a software developer based in São Paulo, Brazil.

I currently work as a data engineer at an international company and have previously worked at Amazon and other companies in the data and software engineering space.

I’m interested in large-scale data systems and applied machine learning. I enjoy building hands-on projects from data pipelines to robotics and visual simulations, and sharing what I learn through tech content.

Outside of work, I explore science, technology, creative coding, data visualization, and game development.
